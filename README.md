MICROSOFT AZURE IN LIFESTYLE INDUSTRY
In this project I am building a machine learning solution on Microsoft Azure and deploying it to predict actual price of the bike according to features.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bike_Price_Prediction.csv contains the dataset used in the project.
data.py is a final python file for the project.
The python script can be executed in any code editor with custom input to predict heart disease.
